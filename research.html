<h1>Research Interest</h1>
<p>There are 10<sup>10</sup> neurons in the human brain, with an average of 10<sup>4</sup> synapses on each. Despite this extremely large and complex configutation, the brain is able to make rapidly store and retrieve information by performing less then 100 computations and in less then a microsecond. It's abilitiy to learn large amounts of information and to be able to apply it under different contexts is something that the most sophisticated AI does not come close to being able to accomplish. Though significant progress has been made in learning how key elements of the brain work, the mechanics of its underlying operating system still remains unknown.</p>
<p>All of my research interests are guided by an overall interest is in learning how the brain's operating system works. In this pursuit, I am interested in learning about the biophysical properties of the brain at every possible level - from the structural mechanics of individual dendritic spines to the connectivity of long range networks.</p>
